## Problem Title
Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
A **Web-Based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software** is an interactive platform designed to simulate the hiring process, allowing users to act as selectors who evaluate and choose candidates from a dynamically generated applicant pool. The system creates realistic applicant profiles containing resumes, skills, educational background, and AI-generated interview responses. Users can review these profiles, rank candidates, and make final selections based on predefined job roles and criteria. After the selection, the system analyzes the choices, compares them to ideal candidates, and provides feedback on accuracy and potential biases. It helps HR professionals, students, and researchers practice hiring decisions in a controlled environment, improving their evaluation skills. The software can be used for recruitment training, bias detection studies, and gamified learning experiences. Optional features like bias injection, diversity metrics, and performance scoring add depth to the simulation. A user-friendly dashboard makes the selection process engaging, and reports are generated for analysis and feedback. Overall, it serves as a valuable tool to enhance hiring practices through realistic, interactive simulations.

## Technology Stack
The technology stack for a **Web-Based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software** includes **React.js** or **Vue.js** for building an interactive and responsive user interface, along with **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** for modern styling. The backend can be powered by **Node.js with Express.js** or **Django** for robust API development and handling business logic. For data storage, **MongoDB** is suitable for flexible document-based storage, while **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** can be used if relational databases are preferred. To generate AI-based applicant responses, **OpenAI GPT API** or **ChatGPT API** can be integrated. The application can be hosted using **Vercel** or **Netlify** for frontend, and **Heroku**, **Render**, or **AWS** for backend hosting. **MongoDB Atlas** serves as a managed cloud database. Authentication and secure user sessions can be handled using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. Tools like **GitHub** for version control and **Postman** for API testing ensure smooth development. Optionally, **Docker** can be used for containerization, making deployment and scaling easier.

## Dependencies
The **dependencies** for a **Web-Based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software** will include several important packages and libraries to support its functionality. On the **frontend**, dependencies like **React.js** (or Vue.js) for UI, **React Router** for navigation, and **Axios** for API calls are essential. **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** can be used for responsive styling. On the **backend**, **Express.js** (if using Node.js) will handle routing and middleware, while **Mongoose** is used for MongoDB integration. **JWT (jsonwebtoken)** will manage secure user authentication, and **bcrypt.js** for password hashing. For AI response generation, integration with **OpenAI's API** will be needed. **Cors** will enable secure cross-origin requests, and **Dotenv** to manage environment variables. Finally, **Nodemon** can be added for auto-restarting the backend server during development.
